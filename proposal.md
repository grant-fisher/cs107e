Name of the project: CNC DRAWING MACHINE

Team members and their responsibilities:
Ryan Ressmeyer: Hardware - building and wiring the physical machine and writing code to drive stepper motors to move the axes 
Grant Fisher: Software - writing high level code to convert drawings to commands that can be interpreted and converted into specific commands for the machine
Shannon Yan: Software - writing mid level code to control absolute position and whether the pen is drawing or not

Goal of the project: Our project is to assemble and program a CNC drawing machine from used optical disc drives and control it using a Raspberry Pi. A CNC (computer numerical control) drawing machine uses stepper motors to control the relative position of a pen moving along the x and y axes of a sheet of paper. Our goal is to get both axes precisely responsive to programs sent to it from the Raspberry Pi and create a library to draw images.

Milestone for week 10 (1 week left to finish): By Week 10, we hope to get the hardware working so that we can make the plate move based on commands from the Raspberry Pi. We will need to 3D print a few parts and then assemble them together. After that, we can focus on building libraries to draw images and lines.
